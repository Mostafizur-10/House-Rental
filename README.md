# House-Rental
I am very glad that I have priliminary been completed my first website using Django framework. It has been taken 6 weeks long. During that period of time I have been found a lot of barriers both inside and outside of this. I have been mentioned all my views through this project.
<h2>Purpose</h2>
People have to stay in different areas in many kind of purposes like education, business etc. This website will make things easier to get a comfortable place to stay in short span of time.  Some people want to rent their properties like flat, villa, house, hostel . They can use that site for advertisement which may carry more attention for rent.

<h2>Features</h2>
•	Sign Up & Login<br>
•	Responsive navbar<br>
•	Advertisement page<br>
•	Apartment description page<br>
•	Updateable User dashboard<br>
•	Updateable renting status<br>
<p>
<p>
<h2>Software tools</h2>
•	Front-end : HTML, CSS 5, Bootstrap 5<br>
•	Back-end : Javascript, JQuery , Python<br>
•	Database : Django SQlite3<br>
•	Framework : Django<br>
•	Editor : Visual Studio Code<br>
<p>
<p>

<h2>Future works</h2>
1.	Create simple renting community online.<br>
2.	Save time to find needing people for apartments<br>
3.	Get useful informations from distant places.<br>
4.	Reduce vacancy percentage<br>
5.	Increase rents<br>
<p>
<p>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
1.	Wrong postal code will not provide any locations in description page.<br>
2.	Phone number varification is not present. So, it may reduce reliability of rent system.<br>
3.	Without google map ,only postal code can’t forward an accurate location for rent finders.<br>
4.	After giving rent , only owners have a part to store rent status.<br>
5.	After publish any ad in server, only admin can customize the ad.<br>
6.  User can only change postal code,price and rental status.<br>
